//! Overwriting file data in place.
//!
//! Btrfs is copy-on-write, so as a rule nothing is written where it
//! already is: a change allocates a new block, records a new checksum,
//! rewrites the B-tree path to the root and commits a new superblock
//! generation. None of that is possible without a transaction engine,
//! and a partial attempt at one produces a filesystem its own checker
//! rejects.
//!
//! There is one exception, and it is the whole of what this module does.
//!
//! # `nodatacow`
//!
//! A file marked `NODATACOW` is deliberately exempt from copy-on-write:
//! its data blocks are overwritten where they lie. Btrfs also clears
//! checksumming for such a file — the flag is set together with
//! `NODATASUM`, because a block that changes in place cannot keep a
//! checksum that was computed elsewhere and committed separately.
//!
//! So for these files, and only these, writing the bytes changes nothing
//! else. No block is allocated. No checksum item exists to update. No
//! tree node is rewritten and no generation is committed. The write is
//! exactly as safe as the equivalent on a filesystem that never had
//! copy-on-write to begin with.
//!
//! # The one thing that is not obvious
//!
//! `NODATACOW` is not a promise that the extent will be written in
//! place. It is a promise that it will be written in place **while it
//! belongs to one file**. Take a snapshot and the extent becomes shared;
//! the next write to it copies first, because the snapshot must keep
//! seeing what it saw. A driver that honoured the flag and skipped that
//! check would silently rewrite what a snapshot is still pointing at.
//!
//! Sharing is visible in the extent tree, as a reference count on the
//! extent item, but not only there. A snapshot of a tree taller than one
//! leaf adds references to the tree blocks under the root, not to the
//! data extents, so the count stays at one while the snapshot reads the
//! extent (#173). The kernel's nocow check handles that case with the
//! tree's `last_snapshot`: an extent from that generation or earlier may be
//! shared. This refuses a count above one, and also any extent the last
//! snapshot could still be reading. Those lookups are the reason this
//! module is more than a byte copy.
