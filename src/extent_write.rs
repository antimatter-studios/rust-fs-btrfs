//! Recording that a tree block is allocated.
//!
//! [`crate::block_group`] finds an address that is free.  Nothing yet
//! makes it stop being free, so asking twice returns the same answer
//! twice and the second block lands on the first.  This writes the item
//! that closes that gap.
//!
//! # The shape, measured
//!
//! On a filesystem with `SKINNY_METADATA` -- the default for years -- an
//! allocated tree block is one 33-byte item, and every one of the 2,603
//! on the deep fixture has the same layout:
//!
//! ```text
//!   key   objectid = the block's address
//!         type     = METADATA_ITEM (169)
//!         offset   = the block's LEVEL, not its length
//!
//!   body   0  refs        u64  = 1 for a block one tree points at
//!          8  generation  u64  the transaction that allocated it
//!         16  flags       u64  = 2, TREE_BLOCK
//!         24  ref type    u8   = 0xb0, TREE_BLOCK_REF
//!         25  ref offset  u64  the objectid of the tree that owns it
//! ```
//!
//! The last nine bytes are an inline back reference.  Btrfs can store a
//! reference either inside the extent item or as a separate keyed item,
//! and for a tree block with a single owner it is always inline -- which
//! is why 33 bytes is not a coincidence but the only size observed.
//!
//! # Without the feature
//!
//! Without `SKINNY_METADATA` the same fact is recorded as an
//! `EXTENT_ITEM` whose offset really is a length, carrying an extra
//! `btrfs_tree_block_info` between the flags and the reference.  That
//! shape is refused rather than approximated: a 33-byte item written
//! where a 51-byte one belongs is not a smaller version of the right
//! answer.
