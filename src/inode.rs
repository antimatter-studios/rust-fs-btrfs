//! On-disk inode (`struct btrfs_inode_item`) parsing.
//!
//! # Where an inode lives
//!
//! Btrfs has no inode table. An inode is an *item* in a subvolume's file
//! tree, filed under the key `(ino, INODE_ITEM_KEY, 0)`, and its number
//! is the key's objectid rather than anything stored in the item. That
//! is why [`Inode::parse`] is handed the number instead of reading one:
//! there is nothing in these 160 bytes that says which inode they
//! describe.
//!
//! It also means the identity checks the sister XFS driver performs on
//! every inode — "does this record agree that it is inode N?" — have no
//! counterpart here. What stands in their place is one level up: the
//! tree block the item came from carries a checksum, its own logical
//! address and the filesystem UUID, all three of which
//! [`crate::btree::TreeBlock::parse`] verifies before any item inside it
//! is handed out.
//!
//! # Layout

//! ```
//!
//! The struct is packed, so `mode` and the three `u32`s before it sit on
//! 4-byte boundaries only by coincidence and the timestamps sit on none
//! at all — a `btrfs_timespec` is a `u64` second count followed by a
//! `u32` nanosecond count, twelve bytes, no padding.
//!
//! # Byte order
//!
//! Little-endian throughout, like the rest of the format.
//!
//! # Confidence
//!
//! Every offset above is corroborated by real media rather than recalled:
//!
//! - The 160-byte total is confirmed twice over. Every one of the 80,004
//!   `INODE_ITEM`s across the `deep4k` and `deep16k` fixtures has a data
//!   length of exactly 160, and `struct btrfs_root_item` opens with an
//!   embedded inode item followed by `generation` and `root_dirid`,
//!   which puts its `bytenr` at 176 — the offset `tests/fstree_oracle.rs`
//!   already relies on and which yields a tree block that passes its own
//!   identity check.
//! - `mode` at 52 reads `0o40755` for the root directory of every
//!   fixture, and its top nibble is `4` (directory) for exactly the two
//!   directories in `deep4k` and `8` (regular) for the other 20,000
//!   inodes.
//! - `nlink` at 40, `size` at 16 and `nbytes` at 24 read 1, 8 and 4096
//!   for that same root directory, which is what an eight-byte, one-link
//!   directory occupying one 4 KiB block should say.
//! - The four timestamps at 112/124/136/148 all decode to seconds inside
//!   the fixture's build window with nanosecond counts below one second,
//!   across 320,016 fields. A wrong offset does not produce that.
//!
//! One thing the fixtures cannot settle is the **order of `ctime` and
//! `mtime`**. Both hold the same value on every fixture inode, so
//! swapping them would go unnoticed here; the order below is the one the
//! published field order gives, and it is called out again at the
//! constants themselves.
