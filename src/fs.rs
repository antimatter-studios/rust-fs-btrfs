//! # Getting to the data
//!
//! Btrfs does not name the fs tree in its superblock, so mounting is a
//! four-step bootstrap and every step must succeed before the next is
//! even addressable:
//!
//! 1. Parse the superblock at 64 KiB.
//! 2. Build a chunk map from the `sys_chunk_array` embedded in it —
//!    enough to reach the chunk tree and nothing else.

///
/// - `logical + len`, guarded by `checked_add`;
/// - the round-up to a sector boundary, `div_ceil(sector) * sector` --
///   `div_ceil` cannot overflow, division only shrinks, but the
///   multiplication that rounds back up can, for an `end` within one
///   sector of `u64::MAX`. This is the guard that matters: `checked_mul`
///   catches every case, and dropping it is not covered by the
///   subtraction below despite first appearances.
/// - `last - first`, guarded by `checked_sub` -- and, given the
///   multiplication above already succeeded (so `last` is the true,
///   un-wrapped ceiling), THIS CANNOT ACTUALLY UNDERFLOW: ceiling and
///   floor give `first <= logical <= end <= last` unconditionally, so

///
/// Provable, and worth being precise about because the obvious intuition
/// is the opposite one and it is wrong: `checked_sub` does NOT generally
