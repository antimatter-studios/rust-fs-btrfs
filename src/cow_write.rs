//! Writing an ordinary, copy-on-write file (#61).
//!
//! [`crate::write`] overwrites a `nodatacow` file where its bytes lie.
//! Every other file is copy-on-write: an extent, once committed, is never
//! changed, so writing a byte of one means a new extent holding the new
//! bytes, the file's item pointed at it, and the old one released — then
//! all of that committed as one transaction, so a crash leaves either the
//! old file or the new one and never a mixture.
//!
//! # What a write does
//!
//! For each extent item the range touches:
//!
//! 1. **A new extent** is found in a data block group
//!    (`Filesystem::find_data_extents`), as long as the bytes the item
//!    covers, and filled with them — the old contents with the write
//!    applied. The copy is the item's window of the old extent, not the
//!    whole of it, so the new item references all of its extent from
//!    offset zero.
//! 2. **The file's `EXTENT_DATA` item** is pointed at it, in place: the
//!    item keeps its size, so its leaf cannot overflow.
//! 3. **The extent tree** loses the old extent's `EXTENT_ITEM` and gains
//!    one for the new, with an inline `EXTENT_DATA_REF` back to the file.
//! 4. **The free-space tree** and the **block groups' `used`** follow, and
//!    the superblock's `bytes_used` moves by whatever the copy is shorter
//!    than the extent it replaced.
//! 5. **The inode** is stamped with the transaction, a new change count
//!    and new change and modification times.
//!
//! The data goes to every mirror first; then the tree blocks, a flush,
//! the superblocks and a flush, in [`Filesystem::commit`]'s order. Until
//! the superblocks land, nothing points at the new extent.
//!
//! # What it refuses
//!
//! Each refusal is a case not yet written, named so a caller can tell
//! which it met:
//!
//! - a **checksummed** file: its new extent needs `EXTENT_CSUM` items and
//!   its old one's removed, and the checksum tree is not written yet;
//! - a write that **grows** the file, or lands in a **hole**: both
//!   allocate where the file has no extent item to repoint;
//! - an **inline**, **preallocated** or **compressed** extent: each
//!   changes the item's kind, not only where it points;
//! - a **shared** extent — more than one reference, or one the last
//!   snapshot could still be reading: releasing it would free bytes
//!   another reader holds.
//!
//! A write in a `nodatacow` file goes to [`Filesystem::write_at`], which
//! writes in place and commits nothing.
