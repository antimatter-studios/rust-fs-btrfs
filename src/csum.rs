//! The checksum tree: what the filesystem says its data should hash to.
//!
//! Btrfs checksums data as well as metadata. Every sector of every
//! ordinary data extent has a digest filed in a tree of its own, keyed
//! by the sector's logical address, and the kernel verifies each one on
//! the way out. A driver that skips the check hands back bit-rotted or
//! clobbered bytes with a successful return — the one failure a caller
//! cannot detect, and the one this crate's module docs say it exists to
//! prevent.
//!
//! ## How the tree is keyed
//!
//! One objectid, one type, and the logical address in the offset:
//!
//! ```text
//! objectid = BTRFS_EXTENT_CSUM_OBJECTID  (-10, i.e. u64::MAX - 9)
//! type     = BTRFS_EXTENT_CSUM_KEY       (128)
//! offset   = logical address of the first sector the item covers
//! ```
//!
//! An item's data is a packed array of digests, `csum_size` bytes each,
//! covering consecutive sectors from `offset` onwards. So one item can
//! describe a long run, and the item covering a given sector is the
//! **last** one whose offset is at or below it — not necessarily one
//! filed at exactly that address. Looking up an exact key finds a
//! checksum only when the sector happens to start a run, which is the
//! easy mistake to make here and would leave most sectors silently
//! unchecked.
//!
//! ## What absence means
//!
//! Not every sector has a digest, and a missing one is not a fault:
//!
//! - a file marked `NODATASUM` has none by definition;
//! - `NODATACOW` implies `NODATASUM`, because a block rewritten in
//!   place cannot keep a checksum consistent with itself;
//! - a preallocated extent holds no data yet.
//!
//! So absence is "nothing to check", and only a digest that is present
//! and does not match is an error. That asymmetry is the whole policy:
//! the tree is authoritative about the sectors it names and silent
//! about the rest.
