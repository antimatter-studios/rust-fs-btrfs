//! Btrfs superblock parsing and validation.
//!
//! # Byte order
//!
//! **Btrfs stores every multi-byte on-disk field little-endian**, on
//! every host, including the checksum. That uniformity is worth stating
//! explicitly because the sister XFS driver in this family is the exact
//! opposite — big-endian everywhere *except* its CRC, which is stored
//! little-endian. A reader that carries the XFS habit across will get
//! Btrfs wrong in a way no round-trip test can see: a writer and reader
//! that share a byte-order mistake agree with each other perfectly while
//! disagreeing with every real filesystem.
//!
//! # Layout
//!
//! The superblock is a fixed [`SUPER_INFO_SIZE`]-byte (4 KiB) structure
//! written at up to three fixed *physical* offsets — see
//! [`SUPER_OFFSETS`]. Copy 0 at 64 KiB is the primary; a copy is only
//! written when the device is large enough to hold it. Every copy is
//! self-describing: `bytenr` records the offset the copy belongs at, so a
//! misdirected read is detectable independently of the checksum.
//!
//! # Checksum
//!
//! The first [`CSUM_SIZE`] (32) bytes hold the checksum. It covers bytes
//! `0x20 .. 0x1000` — that is, the whole 4 KiB superblock *minus* the
//! checksum field itself, not merely the fields this driver happens to
//! parse and not merely up to the end of some sub-structure. Getting that
//! span wrong is invisible to a self-built fixture and fatal on real
//! media.
//!
//! Only the first `csum_type.digest_len()` bytes of the 32-byte field are
//! meaningful; the writer zero-fills the rest and the kernel compares
//! only the meaningful prefix. This driver does the same.
//!
//! # Confidence
//!
//! Every offset in [`offsets`] was taken from the published on-disk
//! format tables and cross-checked against the field order of
//! `struct btrfs_super_block`. Anything that could not be corroborated by
//! two independent sources is called out in a comment at its use site.
