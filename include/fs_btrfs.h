/*
 * fs_btrfs.h — C ABI for the pure-Rust Btrfs driver.
 *
 * Link against libfs_btrfs.a. Distinct handles are independent; a single
 * handle must not be used concurrently from two threads.
 *
 * Error convention: functions returning int return 0 on success and -1
 * on failure; functions returning a pointer return NULL. In either case
 * fs_btrfs_last_error() gives a message for the calling thread and
 * fs_btrfs_last_errno() a POSIX errno suitable for returning to a
 * filesystem client.
 *
 * The driver is read-only, and refuses rather than guesses. A compressed
 * extent fails with ENOTSUP rather than returning its undecoded bytes,
 * because a caller cannot distinguish those from a corrupt file.
