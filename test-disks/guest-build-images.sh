# guest-build-images.sh <output-dir> <target>... — GUEST side: runs as
# root inside the fs-linux-test-harness VM (Debian), started by
# test-disks/build-fixtures.sh through `vm.sh run`.
#
# ONE FILE, BECAUSE THE RECIPES ARE ONE THING. This replaces nine
# scripts: scripts/build-fixtures-native.sh (which CI ran on the runner,
# with sudo), the eight scripts/build-*-fixtures.sh it could not cover,
# scripts/fixture-geometries.sh, and the eight scripts/vm-build-*.sh
# wrappers that ran the same recipes through this repository's own VM.
# Two builders meant two chances to build a different filesystem, and
# that happened: the compression and nodatacow images existed only on
# developers' machines, so their oracles found nothing in CI and
# reported success (#69).
#
# EVERY FIXTURE HERE NEEDS THE REAL KERNEL, and most of them need a
# mount: subvolumes and snapshots, extended attributes, `chattr +C`, a
# compressing mount, a leaf split caught in the act, a two-device pool.
# None of that can happen on a host that is not Linux, and none of it
# should happen on a CI runner, where `sudo mount -o loop` is a
# privilege this suite should not need and a macOS developer cannot
# have. It happens in the guest, which is the one place with a kernel
# we chose.
#
# Every image is built on the guest's own disk and copied to
# <output-dir> (on the share) only once it is complete and unmounted, so
# a failure half way never leaves a truncated image where the host picks
# fixtures up.
#
# DETERMINISM. What `mkfs.btrfs` writes carries a fresh UUID per build
# and the kernel stamps generation and mount times as it goes, so two
# builds are identical in STRUCTURE AND CONTENT rather than byte for
# byte. Tests compare against the superblock dump and the manifests
# taken from the same build, never across builds.

#   collide.txt   TWO NAMES THAT HASH TO THE SAME KEY. Btrfs files an
#                 attribute under (ino, 24, crc32c(~1, name)), so
#                 colliding names share one item and their records are

#
# An ACL is an extended attribute (`system.posix_acl_access`, or
# `system.posix_acl_default` on a directory) whose value has a format of
# its own: a 4-byte header carrying version 2, then one 8-byte entry per
# ACL entry. The value is the kernel's to write, so everything here is
# set through setfacl or created under a default ACL and left for the
# kernel to fill in.

#                     which brings a mask with it — five entries.
#   mixed.txt         named users AND named groups, so the tags sort.
#   sweep/            one file per entry count, from five up to the
#                     largest the node size admits (see below).

#   maxdir/           a directory whose access ACL AND default ACL are
#                     both the largest the node size admits — two items
#                     that cannot share a leaf on a 4 KiB node — and a
#                     file and a directory created under it, which
#                     inherit that largest default.
#
# THE BOUNDARY. Btrfs keeps every attribute inline, in one item of one
# leaf; there is no out-of-line value to spill into. So the largest ACL
# is set by the node size: the kernel refuses a value whose name and
# value would not fit an item in an otherwise empty leaf, with ENOSPC.
# That largest count is FOUND here, by bisecting on what setfacl is
# allowed to set, rather than computed — the arithmetic is the test's
# to check against it — and recorded in the manifest with the refusal
# the next count up met.
#
# The manifest is `getfattr -R -d -m - -e hex`, as the xattr fixture's,

#
#   nc/inplace.bin  written into a `chattr +C` directory, so the kernel
#                   marks it NODATACOW, which implies NODATASUM: it has
#                   no checksums at all. A driver that treated a missing
#                   digest as damage would refuse this file, which the
#                   kernel reads happily — the failure that is worse for
#                   a user than the one being guarded against.
#   cow.bin         an ordinary file beside it, so every sector has a
#                   digest in the csum tree. Without it a driver that
#                   simply refused every read would pass the first half.
#
# And a second image: the same file AFTER A SNAPSHOT (#63). A snapshot
# does NOT raise a data extent's reference count when the subvolume's
# tree is taller than one leaf — `btrfs_copy_root` adds a reference to
# each block the root points at, and those are tree blocks, not data. So
# `nc/inplace.bin`'s extent still reads `refs 1` while the snapshot
# reads the same bytes. The kernel tells the two apart with the fs
# tree's `last_snapshot`. The 3000 empty files in `many/` are only there
# so the fs tree is a node before the snapshot is taken, and the build
# checks that it is.
#
# It goes in its own directory: the suites that walk every image in
# test-disks/ assume what an ordinary volume holds, and a snapshot
# breaks that on purpose — the blocks under the shared root carry two
# inline references, a 42-byte METADATA_ITEM where every other image has
# 33.

# `src/leaf_edit.rs` refuses an item that will not fit rather than
# splitting the leaf, because where the kernel puts the boundary is a

# distribution says what the results look like, not what the rule is.
#
# This catches the event itself. Files are added one at a time, each
# committed, and after each the fs tree's leaves are counted from the
# reference tool's own dump. When the count goes up, the previous image
# is the "before" and the current one is the "after".
#
# The `-vary` pair makes the items WILDLY different sizes, by
# alternating a near-maximum filename with a one-character one. That is
# the experiment that separates the two candidate rules: a split at half
# the ITEM COUNT does not care about sizes, and a split at half the
# BYTES lands somewhere else entirely once the items are uneven. With
# every item the same size the two agree and the measurement says
