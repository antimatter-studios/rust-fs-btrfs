# build-fixtures.sh [target...]  build the test-disks/ fixtures

#                                only those, e.g.
#                                `build-fixtures.sh split pool`
# build-fixtures.sh --check      exit 1 naming every fixture that is missing
# build-fixtures.sh --list       print the targets, in build order
# build-fixtures.sh --artefacts  print every file a full build produces
#
# THE HOST SIDE, AND IT DOES NOT BUILD ANYTHING. Every one of these
# fixtures needs the real kernel — most of them need a mount — so the
# work happens in the fs-linux-test-harness VM (the sibling checkout at
# ../fs-linux-test-harness, moved to its pinned ref by `chore
# siblings`): test-disks/guest-build-images.sh runs as root in the
# guest, writes finished artefacts into the shared directory, and this
# script moves them into test-disks/ on the host.
#
# That is the whole point of the migration this replaced. The old
# arrangement had two builders — one that ran in this repository's own
# VM for macOS developers, one that ran on the CI runner with `sudo
# mount -o loop` — and they disagreed: the compression and nodatacow
# images existed only on developers' machines, so their oracles found
# nothing in CI and reported success (#69). One builder, one kernel, one
# answer.
#
# THE FIXTURE LIST lives here (ARTEFACTS below) and in chores.yml's
# `fixtures` generates:, which must name the same files.
#
# The VM comes down when this script exits (FLTH_KEEP_VM=1 keeps it up
# for a quicker next run).
