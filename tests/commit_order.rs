//! The order a commit reaches the device in.
//!
//! This is the crash-consistency, not a performance detail. A commit
//! whose superblock reaches the device before the tree blocks it names
//! is not a slower commit; it is a filesystem that a power cut turns
//! into one pointing at blocks that were never written.
//!
//! `scripts/trace-commit.sh` recorded what the kernel actually does, and
//! `docs/transaction-format.md` writes it down:
//!
//!   tree blocks (every mirror) → flush → superblocks → flush
//!
//! So the device here records every operation in sequence and the
//! assertions are about that sequence. A real device cannot be asked
//! what order it saw things in, which is the whole reason this is a
//! recording one.
