//! What survives an interruption: a commit of this crate cut at every
//! point it can be cut, and a log tree the kernel wrote and never
//! replayed. THE KERNEL DECIDES, and `btrfs check` beside it.
//!
//! # The commit, stopped halfway
//!
//! `tests/commit_order.rs` pins the order a commit reaches the device in
//! — tree blocks (every mirror), flush, superblocks, flush — and
//! `src/commit.rs` explains why that order is the crash-consistency. That
//! is reasoning about the property. This tests it: a real transaction of
//! this crate is recorded write by write, and every image a power cut
//! could leave behind is handed to the in-kernel driver and to the
//! checker. Each must either mount and show EXACTLY the filesystem before
//! the commit or EXACTLY the one after it, or refuse. Anything in between
//! — a mount that returns some of the new bytes, a checker that finds a
//! dangling pointer — is the failure the ordering exists to prevent.
//!
//! The cuts: after each tree-block write, with half of one torn, with the
//! device's volatile cache dropping one before the barrier; after each
//! superblock copy; with the primary copy torn; and with the primary
//! dropped while a later copy survived, which a volatile cache is free to
//! do between the two flushes.
//!
//! The transaction relocates the fs tree and changes one file's inline
//! bytes in the relocated leaf, so "before" and "after" differ in a way
//! a mount can see. Both are read off the kernel — the untouched image
//! and the fully committed one — rather than assumed, and every cut is
//! compared with those two.
//!
//! # The log tree nobody replayed
//!
//! `fsync` on btrfs writes a log tree and points the superblock at it;
//! the next mount replays it. Until then the committed trees hold the
//! file as it was BEFORE the fsync, so a reader that ignored `log_root`
//! would hand back exactly the bytes an application was told were
//! durably replaced. This crate does not replay a log; it refuses the
//! mount. The fixture is a kernel image copied while the log was live,
//! and the test pins the refusal, shows what ignoring the log would have
//! returned, and has the kernel replay it for comparison.
//!
//! This crate writes no log tree, so "a log tree this crate wrote,
//! replayed by the kernel" has no subject here.
