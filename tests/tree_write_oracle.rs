//! Every leaf the kernel wrote, rebuilt and compared byte for byte.
//!
//! A copy-on-write writer's first act is to produce a tree block. If the

//! wrong in ways that read back perfectly: an item offset measured from
//! the wrong place still parses if every item is measured the same way,
//! and a checksum over the wrong span is still a checksum.
//!
//! So the oracle is the kernel's own blocks. Every leaf in every fixture
//! is taken apart into its items, rebuilt through
//! [`fs_btrfs::tree_write::build_leaf`], and required to come back
