#
# THREE RULES, ALL OF THEM THE ORACLE'S. The btrfs-progs tools and the
# kernel oracles run inside the fs-linux-test-harness VM, which sees this
# repository mounted at the path the host knows it by AND NOTHING ELSE OF
# THE HOST:
#
#   * a scratch image under `/tmp` is a path the tool asked to read it
#     cannot open, and the failure arrives as a puzzling "No such file or
#     directory" from a guest, a long way from the line that chose it;
#   * a fixture under `.vm-share` is a fixture in the directory a run
#     hands things across in, which is how a scratch image one test left
#     behind became a fixture the next suite walked over;
#   * and `sudo` is a privilege this suite no longer asks for anywhere,
#     because the mounts happen in the guest.
#
# `fs_btrfs_test_support::temp_dir()` (and the `temp_path!` macro) is the
# one way to a scratch path; `fixture()` and `fixture_dir()` are the one
# way to a fixture. tests/test_contract.rs is the thorough version of
# this, in Rust, over the parsed sources; this is the cheap one that also
# covers the shell and the workflow.
#
# EVERY CHECK BELOW IS A CODE SHAPE, not a word. Prose that says "this
# used to run under sudo on the runner" is exactly the sort of comment
# worth keeping, and a guard that forbade the word would delete the
# history along with the practice.

# installs the HOST's own packages (ripgrep) with the system package
# manager, and `scripts/trace-commit.sh` is a root-only blktrace
# diagnostic meant to be run in the guest. `ci.yml` uses it once, to
# REPLACE the runner's btrfs-progs with stubs that fail loudly, which is
