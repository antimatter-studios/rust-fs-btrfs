# fixture-builder.sh — the fixture builder refuses rather than skips, and
# the two halves of it agree about what a build produces.
#
# THE FAILURE THIS GUARDS AGAINST HAS HAPPENED HERE TWICE. A geometry
# mkfs.btrfs rejected used to leave the builder green with a warning, and
# the suites that read that image took their absent-fixture path and
# passed (#140); and the compression and nodatacow images were built by
# one builder and not the other, so their oracles compared nothing on
# every pull request (#69). There is one builder now — a host-side driver
# and a guest-side recipe file — and this checks that it stops when a
# fixture cannot be made, and that the driver's artefact list, the guest
# recipes and chores.yml's `generates:` still describe the same build.
#
# The guest recipes are exercised with `mkfs.btrfs`, `btrfs` and `id`
# stubbed, so this needs no VM, no root and no btrfs-progs — which is
# what lets it run in the unit-shaped `chore test:scripts` tier.
