//! A compressed stream that decodes short is refused anywhere but the
//! file's last extent (#189).
//!
//! `decompress` pads a short decode with zeros up to `ram_bytes`. That is
//! right for the last extent of a file, where the tail of the final sector
//! holds nothing. Anywhere else it turns a truncated or damaged stream into
//! a run of zeros — which is legitimate file content, so a caller cannot
//! tell it from data. Every other decode failure in that module is
//! reported; this one was not, and it is the one that hides damage.
//!
//! THE IMAGE IS THE LZO FIXTURE, on a copy this test is free to damage.
//! `test-disks/btrfs-comp-lzo.img` is written by the kernel through a
//! `compress=lzo` mount in the harness guest (`chore fixtures`), which is
//! the only way to get a compressed extent — `mkfs.btrfs --rootdir` does
//! not compress. Its `/big.txt` is 1.7 MiB of text, so it spans many
//! compressed extents and its first one is not its last.
//!
//! That extent's LZO stream then has its length header lowered so it ends
//! after one segment: the decoder finishes cleanly and hands back a
//! fraction of the bytes the item promises, which is what a truncated or
//! damaged stream looks like from the reader's side. Truncating the
//! *input* instead is caught by the framing — this is the case that is
//! not.
//!
//! The inode is marked `nodatasum` for the same reason the write-side
//! fixtures do: the checksums cover the bytes on disk, and this edits
//! them.
//!
//! Nothing here skips. The fixture is built by `chore fixtures` and a
//! missing one fails the test that wanted it, naming the task that
//! builds it — this suite used to make its own image with `sudo mount -o
//! loop` on the host and return early wherever that was not possible,
//! which is a pass that has checked nothing.
