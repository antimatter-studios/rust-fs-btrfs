//! What a planned transaction contains, checked against a real one.
//!
//! `Filesystem::plan_transaction` works out which blocks a change makes
//! the filesystem rewrite. `docs/cow-transaction.md` measured what the
//! kernel rewrote for one `touch` on the same filesystem, so the plan
//! has something to be compared against that was not written to fit it.
//!
//! The comparison is a containment, not an equality, and the reason is
//! the planner's own documented boundary: it computes the spine — the
//! dirty blocks, their ancestors, and the root tree leaf naming the
//! tree whose root moved — and does not model the extent, free-space and
//! dev tree rewrites that recording those allocations causes. So the
//! trees it names must be among the trees the kernel touched, and must
//! include the ones the spine implies.
//!
//! # Both geometries, every run
//!
//! The COW pairs exist twice: on a default `mkfs.btrfs`, and on a volume
//! made with `--csum sha256 -d dup -m dup`. Which one these tests
//! planned against used to depend on `BTRFS_COW_SUFFIX`, set by the
//! workflow that ran the suite — so a plan was only ever held to the DUP
//! geometry where somebody had remembered to ask for it, and a job that
//! stopped setting it would have taken that coverage away silently. Both
//! are required here, both are planned against, and a failure names the
//! one it came from.
//!
//! The fixtures are gitignored and built by `chore fixtures`.
