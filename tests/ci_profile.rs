//! The debug run that lets the PR gate see an overflow guards itself.
//!
//! `overflow-checks` is on in the debug profile and off in release, so a
//! defect whose only symptom is an arithmetic overflow panic cannot be
//! observed by a release-only test run. Everything below exists to keep
//! one sentence true:
//!
//! > the pull-request gate still builds the library's own unit tests in
//! > the debug profile, with `EXPECT_OVERFLOW_CHECKS=1` set, on a job
//! > that actually gates the merge.
//!
//! # The sentence now has three links, and each breaks on its own
//!
//! `ci.yml` used to run `cargo test` itself. It does not any more:
//! every job in it runs chore tasks and nothing else, and the cargo
//! invocations live in `chores.yml`, wrapped in `scripts/tier.sh` (the
//! output budget) around `scripts/test.sh` (the scratch directory),
//! with the target list produced by `scripts/test-targets.sh`. So the
//! one step this guard used to read has become a chain, and a chain is
//! only as good as the link nobody checked:
//!
//! | link | what it rules out | pinned by |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `ci.yml` still runs `chore test:unit` on a gating job | the task being perfect and nothing calling it | [`the_pr_gate_still_tests_the_library_in_a_profile_that_can_see_an_overflow`] |
//! | `chores.yml`'s `test:unit` is the debug run it says it is | the job running a task that has quietly gained `--release`, or lost the handshake | [`the_debug_run_asks_the_build_to_prove_it_traps_overflows`] |
//! | `scripts/test-targets.sh unit` still names `--lib` | the workflow and the task both being right while the list they agree on stopped containing the library | [`the_unit_tier_target_list_still_names_the_library`] |
//!
//! The third link is the one a comment cannot replace. The task body
//! says `$(scripts/test-targets.sh unit)`: read as text it proves
//! nothing about what that command prints, so the script is RUN. It is
//! cheap, it needs no fixture, no tool and no VM -- which is what lets
//! this file sit in the `unit` tier it is guarding.
//!
//! # This repository is not in the same position as its siblings
//!
//! Stated plainly, because the difference is the whole reason this file
//! is shaped the way it is, and a guard ported from a sibling would be
//! satisfied here while the defect was still live.
//!
//! `ci.yml` **does** run tests in the debug profile on a pull request,
//! and always did. What matters is which *targets* those runs build.
//! Three of the four tiers -- `test:images`, `test:oracle`,
//! `test:kernel` -- take their targets from
//! `scripts/test-targets.sh <tier>`, which emits nothing but
//! `--test <name>` arguments, and `cargo test --test <name>` selects one
//! integration target and never builds the library's own unit tests.
//! The whole-suite run in `test:native` does build them, and is
//! `--release`. So "does any debug `cargo test` run on this trigger" is
//! the wrong question here: the answer is yes, and it was yes on the
//! tree where the library's arithmetic -- the largest body of it in the
//! crate -- was compiled with the checks on nowhere but a version tag.
//!
//! That is why the scan refuses a run whose targets come from a tier
//! other than `unit`, and why it refuses `--test <name>` however the
//! line is spelled. Drop either and the guard passes on the tree as it
//! stood before this change, which is the precise definition of a check
//! that cannot fail for the reason it exists.
//!
//! The file scoping is load-bearing for the same reason it always was.
//! `release.yml` runs `chore test` -- the whole gate, `test:unit`
//! included -- on a version tag, after the change has merged, detached
//! from the change and from the person who could have caught it. A scan
//! widened across every workflow would find the unit task running there
//! and report this repository as covered while the pull-request gate had
//! lost it, so the guard opens `ci.yml` and only `ci.yml`
//! ([`a_debug_run_outside_ci_yml_does_not_satisfy_this_guard`]).
//!
//! # Two halves, neither redundant
//!
//! | half | asks | cannot answer |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | the scans here | is the task still run by a gating job, still covering the library, still asked to check, and not disabled from the manifest | whether the build it produces actually traps |
//! | `overflow_checks` in `src/lib.rs` | does this build trap a real `u64::MAX + 1` | whether it was supposed to; it cannot notice its own absence |
//!
//! Delete the step and the runtime probe never runs at all. Keep the
//! step but drop the variable and the probe runs, finds nothing to
//! check, and passes doing nothing. Keep both and put
//! `overflow-checks = false` under `[profile.test]` and the step is
//! present, running, green and blind. Each needs its own guard.
//!
//! # Why this is an integration test and not a module under `src/`
//!
//! Cargo discovers `tests/*.rs` on its own, so there is no declaration
//! anywhere that can be deleted to switch this off, and `Cargo.toml`
//! sets no `autotests = false`. A guard living as a file under `src/`
//! behind a `#[cfg(test)] mod` line has no such protection: lose the
//! one line and the file stays, compiles into nothing, and asserts
//! nothing, with no lint to say so. That happened once already on a
//! sibling repository's version of this fix -- a `git reset --hard`
//! took the `mod` line, the suite went green, and seven assertions
//! silently ceased to exist.
//!
//! The runtime probe in `src/lib.rs` is the deliberate exception, and
//! is inline in `lib.rs` for the same reason: it must be part of the
//! library target the `unit` tier builds, and inline there is no
//! declaration to lose.

/// The first version of this guard matched the text of a `- run:` line
/// and never looked at anything else in the step. That is enough to
/// find the command and useless for deciding whether the command's
/// result is read. Measured against this repository's own workflow:
/// adding `if: false` to the step, or `continue-on-error: true`, left
/// every one of the guard's 31 tests green while the gate went blind.
/// A step that runs and whose result nothing reads is this
/// constellation's own named defect, reproduced inside the guard
/// written to prevent it.
///
/// So the list is enumerated first, rather than discovered one defeat
/// at a time. A `run:` step gates a pull request only if ALL of these
/// hold:
///
/// 1. the step carries no `if:` -- a false condition skips it;
/// 2. the step carries no `continue-on-error:` -- its failure is
///    discarded;
/// 3. its JOB carries no `if:` -- same reasoning, one level up;
/// 4. its JOB carries no `continue-on-error:`;
/// 5. the workflow's `on:` still includes `pull_request` -- a scan
///    scoped to `ci.yml` assumes `ci.yml` is what runs on a pull
///    request, and that is a fact about the file, not a given.
///
/// OVER-STRICT IS THE SAFE DIRECTION HERE, so 1 and 2 reject on the
/// key's PRESENCE rather than trying to evaluate it. `if: false`,
/// `if: ${{ false }}`, and an `if:` on an expression that happens to
/// evaluate false are distinct spellings, and this crate has already
/// been caught by four spellings of one manifest key -- enumerating
/// them is the losing game. A step that genuinely needs a condition
/// can be split out; a guard that tries to interpret conditions is a
/// guard with a new defeat every time GitHub adds syntax.
///
/// `ci-ok` carries `if: always()` and is therefore not counted. That
/// costs nothing and is right: it aggregates the other jobs' results
/// and runs no test. The jobs that run tests carry no condition at all.
///
/// # Why this is parsed and no longer scanned
///
/// The version this replaces hand-rolled the YAML: `.lines()`, an
/// indent count, `split_once(':')` for the key, and `after != "|"` for
/// a block scalar. It was defeated three more times after the five
/// spellings above, and each defeat was the same shape -- ordinary
/// YAML the scanner had not been taught:
///
/// ```text
///   "if": false               quoted key -- matched no NON_GATING_KEYS
///                             entry, so the step counted as gating
///                             while Actions skipped it. SILENT.
///   "continue-on-error": true same.
///   # pull_request:           a substring match over the `on:` block's
///                             raw text, comments included, so
