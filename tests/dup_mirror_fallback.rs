//! One bad copy of a tree block does not make a DUP volume unreadable.
//!
//! # What this holds that the unit tests do not
//!
//! `Tree::read_block`'s fallback is witnessed three ways in the unit
//! tests — the retry, which error is reported when no copy verifies, and
//! that a good first copy is not read twice. None of them reaches
//! `Filesystem`. Before this file existed, removing all four production
//! opt-ins together — that is, the driver never asking for a second
//! copy at all, which IS the filed defect — left the whole suite green
//! at **416 passed, 0 failed**, which is a figure from that tree and
//! is quoted as history rather than as a current measurement. With this
//! file present the same mutation is EXIT=101 with named failures here.
//!
//! THE OPT-INS ARE NAMED BY FUNCTION AS WELL AS BY LINE, because the
//! numbers in the first version of this paragraph were already stale by
//! the time it was reviewed and a stale pointer sends the next reader
//! to the wrong site:
//!
//! Each removed on its own, re-measured on THIS tree — the earlier
//! figures described a different one:
//!
//! | opt-in | at | removed alone |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `open_pool`, chunk-tree bootstrap walk | `fs.rs:732` | EXIT=101, 4 named failures |
//! | `open_pool`, root-tree walk | `fs.rs:765` | EXIT=101, 2 named failures |
//! | `load_fs_tree` | `fs.rs:1007` | **green** — unwitnessed |
//! | `PoolReader::tree` | `fs.rs:1677` | **green** — unwitnessed |
//!
//! Two of the four are held, and the two that are not say so at their
//! own sites. Zero compile errors in every arm, counted separately from
//! named failures.
//!
//! So the mechanism was held and the plumbing was not. This file is the
//! plumbing: it damages a real `mkfs.btrfs` image and requires the
//! driver to mount it.
//!
//! # Why it is cheap, having been called expensive
//!
//! The first reading of this gap was that it needed a Linux-only image
//! builder. It does not: `.vm-share/btrfs-dup.img` already ships. It is
//! gitignored, so a fresh worktree lacks it and a symlink is enough —
//! which is worth remembering before the next "no fixture available".
//! Public API only, no `mkfs.btrfs`, no VM.
//!
//! # Vacuity
//!
//! Without `.vm-share` this suite reports `ok` having done nothing —
//! the shape of every oracle suite here, and the shape that makes
//! `13 passed in 0.00s` and `13 passed in 33.61s` look identical. So it
//! prints what it did and how long the image was, and the assertions
//! below check the fixture is a DUP one before believing any pass:
//! a chunk with one copy has nothing to fall back to, and a test that
//! "passed" on it would mean nothing at all.
