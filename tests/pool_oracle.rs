//! A filesystem spanning two devices, opened with one.
//!
//! A chunk stripe names the device it lives on. With one device open
//! there is nothing sensible to do about a stripe naming another —
//! reading it from the device at hand returns whatever is at that
//! offset on THIS disk. It parses. It fails its checksum against a
//! block it was never meant to be, and on a mirrored pool, where both
//! disks hold the same data at different offsets, it may not even do
//! that.
//!
//! So the expected behaviour is a refusal, and this holds the driver to
//! it. Reading one disk of a pool as though it were the whole pool is
//! worse than not opening it: the caller gets data rather than an
//! error.
//!
//! The kernel agrees, which is worth knowing: `mount -o loop` on one
//! member fails too, for the same reason. Mounting a pool needs every
//! device registered first, and that is a different thing from opening
//! a filesystem.
//!
//! Fixtures are gitignored. Build them with
//! `./scripts/vm-build-pool-fixtures.sh`.
