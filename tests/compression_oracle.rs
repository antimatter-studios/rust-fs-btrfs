//! Compressed files must come back exactly as the kernel wrote them.
//!
//! Btrfs defines three compression algorithms and they share no code: a
//! reader can have zstd perfectly right and LZO silently wrong. Each one
//! therefore gets its own fixture, written through a mount using that
//! algorithm, with a manifest generated **inside Linux by the kernel's
//! own driver** — path, size and SHA-256 per file. Nothing in this
//! repository decides what the right answer is.
//!
//! LZO is the reason this is a separate suite rather than one more case
//! in `fs_oracle`. zlib and zstd extents are ordinary streams of their
//! respective formats, and any correct decoder reads them. LZO1X has no
//! container at all, so Btrfs wraps it in framing of its own invention:
//! a total length, then per-sector segments, with a segment header never
//! allowed to straddle a sector boundary. That padding rule is invisible
//! in any file short enough to fit in one sector — which is every file a
//! hand-written test is likely to build — so the fixture deliberately
//! includes one large enough to need several.
//!
//! Fixtures are gitignored, so this skips on a fresh clone. Generate
//! them with `./scripts/vm-build-fixtures.sh`.
