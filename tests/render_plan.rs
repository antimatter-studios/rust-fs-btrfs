//! A relocated tree holds what the original held.

//! that goes wrong is not a crash — it is a node still pointing at where
//! a block used to be, which reads perfectly and returns the version
//! before the change.
//!
//! So the check walks the relocated tree and compares what it holds with
//! what the original held, item for item. Nothing is written to the
//! disk: the rendered blocks are held in memory and read back from
//! there, which is the same tree the commit sequencer would produce.
//!
//! Fixtures are gitignored. Build them with `chore fixtures`.
