//! What a read costs, in calls to the device.
//!
//! # Why this is a test and not a benchmark
//!
//! The number that matters is not wall time. Wall time on a laptop with
//! a warm page cache says more about the laptop than the driver: run it
//! twice and the second is faster for reasons this repository does not
//! control. **Calls to the device** are deterministic — the same image
//! walked the same way makes the same calls every time — so they can be
//! asserted on, and a change that makes the driver ask for more is a
//! regression a test can catch rather than a number somebody has to
//! remember.
//!
//! Wall time is printed beside them, because it is what a user feels,
//! and ignored by the assertions.
//!
//! # What is measured
//!
//! Four shapes, because they cost differently and a change can improve
//! one while ruining another:
//!
//! - **mount** — opening the filesystem: the bootstrap, and nothing that
//!   grows with the volume. It loaded every item of the fs tree until
//!   #67, and a figure that grows with the size of the volume rather than
//!   with the work asked of it belongs to this line.
//! - **walk** — every directory in the tree, listed. Metadata only.
//! - **stat** — every file resolved by path from the root. Metadata,
//!   repeatedly, over the same nodes.
//! - **read** — every file's contents. Data, and the extent items that
//!   locate it.
//!
//! The node cache is why `stat` after `walk` reaches the device little or
//! not at all: the interior nodes every path descends were read by the
//! walk.
//!
//! Fixtures are gitignored, so this skips on a fresh clone.
