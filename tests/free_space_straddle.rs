//! A transaction on a block group whose free-space records span two leaves
//! either leaves a free-space tree `btrfs check` accepts, or is refused by
//! name (#177).
//!
//! The free-space tree files each block group's `FREE_SPACE_INFO` item and
//! then its `FREE_SPACE_EXTENT`s in key order, and a leaf can end anywhere
//! among them. The rewrite read a group's run from the leaf holding its INFO
//! item to that leaf's end, and wrote every run of the group back into that
//! leaf. The next leaf kept its own copies of the group's tail, so the tree
//! then recorded that free space twice, out of key order across the leaf
//! boundary: `btrfs check` reports "free space extent ... overlaps with
//! previous". When the group did not fit in the first leaf the render was
//! refused instead, by a message about leaf sizes that did not say why.
//!
//! THE IMAGE IS MADE BY THE KERNEL, in the harness guest, because the shape
//! is the kernel's decision: which leaf boundary falls inside which group.
//! A 4 KiB-node volume with mixed block groups, so the data fragmentation
//! lands in the same groups metadata is allocated from, and a free-space
//! leaf holds ~160 records. `btrfs balance` first relocates mkfs's small
//! first group, which metadata churn would otherwise turn into bitmaps
//! (its threshold is ~11 runs) and which the allocator would then pick
//! for every new block — a bitmap is refused for its own reason before
//! this one is reached. Then 1 MiB files fill most of the volume and every
//! k-th is deleted: each deletion frees exactly one run, and with k = 5 a
//! 320 MiB group holds ~100 runs, well under the kernel's threshold for
//! converting it to bitmaps (~1.4 runs per MiB) while the groups together
//! span several leaves.
//!
//! WHICH GROUPS STRADDLE IS READ FROM btrfs-progs, not from this crate: a
//! group counts when `dump-tree` shows its records in more than one leaf,
//! its INFO item says extents rather than bitmaps, and a leaf of the fs,
//! csum or extent tree lives inside it for the transaction to move. The
//! layout is the kernel's and moves between kernel versions, so each
//! spacing is tried in turn; one that yields no such group is reported
//! with what it did yield, not passed.
