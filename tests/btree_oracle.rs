//! Cross-validation of the B-tree reader against real Btrfs media.
//!
//! The unit tests in `src/btree.rs` parse blocks that module encoded
//! itself, using the same offsets and strides it decodes with. That
//! proves the arithmetic is self-consistent; it cannot prove
//! `struct btrfs_header`, `struct btrfs_item` and `struct btrfs_key_ptr`
//! are laid out the way this crate believes, because a misreading would
//! be baked into both the fixture and the parser and they would agree
//! with each other while agreeing with nothing `mkfs.btrfs` produces.
//!
//! These tests close that gap by reading trees the kernel's own tooling
//! built. The chain they exercise is the real mount path and every link
//! is load-bearing:
//!
//! 1. parse the superblock at [`SUPER_INFO_OFFSET`];
//! 2. bootstrap the chunk map from its embedded system chunk array;
//! 3. translate `chunk_root` and parse the block that lands there;
//! 4. **walk the whole chunk tree** and fold every chunk item into the
//!    map;
//! 5. translate `root` — which is *only* reachable once step 4 has
//!    worked, because the root tree lives in a METADATA chunk that the
//!    bootstrap array does not describe — and parse the block there.
//!
//! Step 5 is the point of the file. A header offset that is off by a
//! byte, an item stride that is wrong, or a key comparison in the wrong
//! field order all make step 4 produce a map that cannot reach the root
//! tree, and the test fails loudly rather than quietly returning
//! plausible nonsense.
//!
//! # What these fixtures do not cover
//!
//! Every tree on a freshly-made, near-empty filesystem fits in a single
//! leaf, so these tests exercise [`TreeBlock`] parsing, leaf item bounds
//! and the leaf half of the search on real media — but **not** the
//! internal-node path: `struct btrfs_key_ptr`'s layout and the descent
//! through a level-1 node are still covered only by hand-built unit
//! tests. Closing that needs a fixture with enough files to force a tree
//! above level 0. The walk test below reports the tallest tree it
//! actually saw, so the gap stays visible rather than being quietly
//! assumed away.
//!
//! Fixtures live in `.vm-share/` as `btrfs-<name>.img`. They are
//! gitignored, so these tests skip on a fresh clone rather than failing.
//! Generate them with:
//!
//! ```sh
//! ./scripts/vm.sh up
//! ./scripts/vm-build-fixtures.sh
//! ```
