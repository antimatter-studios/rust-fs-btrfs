//! What must be true of a transaction, whatever it was for.
//!
//! The remaining piece of the write path decides which blocks a change
//! produces. That decision is recursive — recording an allocation
//! modifies the extent tree, which lives in blocks that must themselves
//! be allocated — and it is the part where a plausible implementation
//! can be wrong in ways that still mount.
//!
//! So the checks come first. These are asserted against the KERNEL's
//! transactions, on before/after image pairs it produced, and they are
//! written before the planner exists precisely so the planner has
//! something to satisfy that was not shaped around it. When it lands,
//! its output goes through the same three assertions.
//!
//! `docs/cow-transaction.md` records what the pairs showed. The short
//! version: an empty commit is not empty — it rewrites the root, extent,
//! free-space and dev trees, four blocks in and four out — and a `touch`
//! costs that floor plus two fs-tree blocks.
//!
//! Fixtures are gitignored. Build them with
//! `./scripts/vm-build-cow-fixtures.sh`.
