# THE RUN OWNS THE VM ITS TESTS BOOT (#141). An oracle or kernel test
# brings the harness VM up from inside its own process, and that boot
# takes the slot -- ONE for the whole machine, shared by every
# repository. Left to chore's `after_all` reaper, which runs only inside
# a chore invocation of this repository, a run that reached cargo any
# other way (this script, scripts/tier.sh, by hand) exited 0 with the VM
# idle and the slot held, and every other repository's VM work queued
# behind it at 0% CPU until the guest's idle deadline.
#
# So cargo runs inside a harness session: vm-session.sh's EXIT trap
# brings the VM down and releases the slot when the run ends -- passed,
# failed or killed -- and its marker keeps another invocation's reaper
# off the VM while the run is using it. The release is the harness's
# own, which frees the slot only when this machine holds it, and only
# once the VM is confirmed stopped. FLTH_KEEP_VM=1 keeps the VM up for
# runs back to back, as it does for `chore fixtures`.
#
# No session where there is no VM to own: inside the guest (`chore
# test:vm`), without the harness sibling (a test that needs the VM then
# fails naming `chore siblings`), or on a host that cannot run the VM at
# all (CI's unit and aarch64 jobs), where a teardown would fail on a
# machine that could never have existed.
