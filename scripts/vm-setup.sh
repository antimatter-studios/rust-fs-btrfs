# THE GUEST IS WHERE THE ORACLE TOOLS LIVE. Not the host: btrfs-progs on
# a workstation is whatever that machine has — a Homebrew formula on a
# Mac, a distribution build on Linux, a different version per developer
# — and on a Mac it is not even the platform these images are for. One
# Debian guest, one version, the same answers for everyone.

#   btrfs-progs  mkfs.btrfs, `btrfs check`, `btrfs inspect-internal
#                dump-super/dump-tree`, `btrfs subvolume` — the oracle
#                tools (tests/support/src/oracle.rs) and the fixture
#                builder's formatter
#   attr         setfattr/getfattr: the extended-attribute fixture both
#                sets attributes with and takes its reference answer
#                from. Without it that fixture builds a filesystem with
#                no attributes and a manifest saying so
#   acl          setfacl/getfacl: the ACL fixture sets its ACLs, finds the
#                largest one the node size admits, and takes the entry
#                counts it records, through them
#   e2fsprogs    chattr/lsattr, which is how a directory is marked
#                NODATACOW — an ext2 tool that btrfs honours
#   python3      the compressible payloads the compression fixtures need
#   util-linux   losetup and mount: the loop mounts, which happen here
#                and nowhere else
#
# THE EXOTIC CHECKSUM MODULES. xxhash, sha256 and blake2 live in
# separate crypto modules, and a mount of such an image is a bad place
# to discover they are missing. They are loaded here so a fixture build
# fails with the reason rather than with "invalid argument".
#
# AND WHAT A RUST BUILD NEEDS FROM THE DISTRIBUTION (curl, gcc, libc6-dev,
# pkg-config), for `chore test:vm`: the whole suite compiled and run in
# here, which is how a macOS host runs a Linux test suite at all. NOT THE
# TOOLCHAIN ITSELF: scripts/guest-suite.sh installs that through
# `scripts/core.sh guest-rust-toolchain`, rust-fs-core's one copy of the
# install, which every driver runs and which recovers from an install a
# reaper or a deadline interrupted. It cannot run from here: the harness
# ships this one file into the guest, before `test:vm` has staged the core
# sibling on the share (rust-fs-core#190).
