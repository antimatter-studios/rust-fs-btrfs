# trace-commit.sh — record the block writes of one live Btrfs commit.
#
# `docs/transaction-format.md` says of write ordering and barrier
# placement: "an I/O trace of a live commit; static images cannot show
# it". This is that trace.
#
# It is the one question about the write path that a fixture cannot
# answer. A finished filesystem shows WHAT was written; it never shows in
# what order, and never where the flushes went. Both are what a
# copy-on-write writer's crash-consistency rests on: the rule is
# supposed to be data, then checksums, then tree blocks leaf-to-root,
# then a barrier, then superblocks — and the document is explicit that
# the ordering is "reasoned rather than observed".
#
# # How it works
#
# blktrace watches the loop device the filesystem is mounted on, one
# `touch` and one `sync` are performed, and blkparse renders the events.
# What matters in the output:
#
#   W          a write, with its sector and size
#   FWFS/FF    a flush — the barrier, which is what orders everything
#              before it against everything after
#   FUA        force-unit-access: this write must reach the medium
#              before it is acknowledged, which is how a superblock is
#              made durable without a second flush
#
# # Reading the result
#
# Sectors are 512 bytes, so a byte offset is `sector * 512`. The
# superblock copies live at 64 KiB, 64 MiB and 256 GiB — sectors 128,
# 131072 and 536870912 — so a write to sector 128 is the primary
# superblock and is expected LAST, after a flush.
